# Photogates4Viscosity
**Introduction.<br/>**
The aim of this project is to develop a more accurate method of calculating the viscosity of oil being used in the determination of the skin friction coefficient over complex geometry. This program uses a pair of photogates, instead of human vision, to monitor the descent of a ball through a tube of oil. The time taken for the ball's descent, once it has reached its terminal velocity, is an indicator of the viscosity of the oil. In this program, the hardware is set up next to the viscometer, so that the photogates can monitor the light being obstructed before them by the ball falling. The photogates note the time at which the light became obstructed, and the time difference between the pairs of obstructions is thus the time the ball took to fall between the two photogates.<br/>
